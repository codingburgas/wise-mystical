Paris
Eiffel Tower, Louvre Museum
Paris was founded towards the end of the 3rd century BC on what is now the Ile de la Cite by a tribe of Celtic Gauls known as the Parisii. Centuries of conflict between the Gauls and Romans ended in 52 BC, when Julius Caesar’s legions took control of the territory. Christianity was introduced in the 2nd century AD, and Roman rule finally ended in the 5th century with the arrival of the Franks. In 508 AD, Frankish king Clovis I united Gaul as a kingdom and made Paris the capital, naming it after the original Parisii tribe.
