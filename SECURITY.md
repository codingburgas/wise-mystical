## Reporting a Vulnerability

You can send an email over to [MDVasilev20@codingburgas.bg] disclosing in detail what the vulnurability is and how you found out about it. If your vulnerability is accepted you should expect updates on it at least once every 24 hours. If it is declined it means that we have concluded that your information is false.
